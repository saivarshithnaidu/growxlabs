                  UniversalAI is an advanced, production-grade AI orchestration and translation platform designed to unify state-of-the-art Large Language Models and specialized tools into a single, high-fidelity workspace. Built on a Next.js and TypeScript framework, it solves the challenge of single-model bias and tool fragmentation by running parallel execution streams from GPT-4o, Gemini Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet side-by-side. The platform integrates a semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for document intelligence, alongside a dedicated AI agent workspace that generates, executes, and previews project files on the fly. By securing conversations through a robust PostgreSQL persistence layer and supporting instant multilingual communication, UniversalAI delivers a scalable, enterprise-ready environment for technical collaboration.

                  RecruitAI is an enterprise-grade, AI-driven talent acquisition and secure assessment platform designed to automate the recruitment pipeline from application to final offer. The platform parses and scores candidate resumes using a multi-model LLM fallback mechanism, matching skills and experience directly to job descriptions. For secure examinations, it deploys a dual-camera proctoring system ("Third Eye") that streams desktop and mobile video feeds using WebRTC, utilizing Supabase Realtime for serverless signaling. Additionally, candidates undergo a voice-based AI interview round driven by browser-native speech-to-text and text-to-speech translation models. By combining automated screening, secure environments, and smart evaluations, RecruitAI establishes an efficient, bias-free, and highly scalable hiring workflow.

                  3RDMIND is an advanced agentic AI platform that simulates, runs, and scales digital startups using a squad of specialized C-suite agents (CEO, CMO, CTO, CFO, CRO, CSO) who collaborate, make decisions, execute tasks, and continuously learn from real-world feedback loops. Built on a decoupled, asynchronous agent-runtime model, the platform features a frontend Dashboard (Next.js), a Supabase Realtime backend, and a centralized Agent Runtime orchestrator powered by OpenRouter models. By tracking judge ratings, conversion outcomes, and natural language user corrections, the Compounding Intelligence Layer automatically updates agent operating strategies without polluting core system prompts.
