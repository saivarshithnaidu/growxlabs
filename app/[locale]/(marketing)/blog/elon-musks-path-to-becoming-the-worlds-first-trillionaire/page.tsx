  const faqData = [
    {
      question: "What is the primary source of Elon Musk’s wealth?",
      answer: "The primary driver of Musk's wealth is his equity ownership in Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX. While Tesla is public and subject to market cycles, SpaceX remains private and has steadily increased in value due to its commercial launch monopoly and the expansion of Starlink."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the Tesla valuation affect the trillionaire timeline?",
      answer: "For Musk to become a trillionaire, Tesla's valuation must rise significantly, likely past the $2 trillion to $3 trillion mark. This expansion is dependent on Tesla successfully commercializing its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and deploying its humanoid robot, Optimus, at scale."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the current SpaceX valuation?",
      answer: "SpaceX has been valued at over $200 billion in private secondary market transactions. Its valuation continues to grow based on launch demand and Starlink’s transition from a capital-expenditure phase to a profitable cash-flow business."
    },
    {
      question: "How does xAI contribute to Musk’s net worth?",
      answer: "xAI represents a fast-growing digital asset. As xAI raises venture capital and develops advanced AI systems, Musk's equity stake increases in value, positioning him to benefit directly from the commercial expansion of frontier AI."
    },
    {
      question: "When could Elon Musk become the world's first trillionaire?",
      answer: "Based on compound annual growth rates of 20% to 25% across his portfolio, projections suggest Musk could reach the trillion-dollar milestone between 2030 and 2035, depending on execution speed and market cycles."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the main risks to Musk achieving this milestone?",
      answer: "The main risks include regulatory delays (from agencies like the FAA, NHTSA, or FDA), increasing global competition in EVs and AI, supply chain disruptions, macroeconomic downturns, and key-man dependency risks."

                The concept of the trillionaire was once confined to the realms of science fiction and long-range economic forecasting. However, as the velocity of technology-driven wealth creation continues to accelerate, financial analysts and market historians are beginning to view the milestone not as a question of "if," but of "when" and "who." 
              </p>
              <p>
                At the center of this speculative discourse is Elon Musk. As the builder of a unique multi-industry empire spanning electric vehicles, aerospace, satellite telecommunications, artificial intelligence, neurotechnology, and infrastructure, his financial trajectory has consistently defied standard wealth accumulation curves.
              </p>
              <p>
                To understand the probability of Elon Musk becoming the <strong>world's first trillionaire</strong>, one must look beyond simple stock market fluctuations. It requires a deep structural analysis of his industrial conglomerate, the compounding dynamics of his equity holdings, and the secular growth trends of the global markets his companies dominate.

                  Tesla transformed the automotive market by proving that electric vehicles could outperform traditional internal combustion engines.

                  To evaluate the feasibility of Elon Musk reaching trillionaire status, it is necessary to establish a clear baseline of his holdings. Unlike traditional billionaires whose wealth is often tied to a single legacy corporation, the <strong>Elon Musk net worth</strong> is highly diversified across several high-growth, capital-intensive technology companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Musk’s primary wealth drivers consist of substantial equity stakes in several major private and public entities:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Musk owns approximately 13% of the outstanding common stock, with additional stock options granted under performance compensation packages.</li>
                  <li><strong>SpaceX</strong>: As a private company, Musk maintains a commanding ownership stake of roughly 42%, alongside holding the majority of voting control.</li>
                  <li><strong>xAI</strong>: Founded in 2023 to compete directly in the frontier AI sector, Musk holds a dominant ownership position.</li>
                  <li><strong>Starlink</strong>: While currently a subsidiary of SpaceX, Starlink's independent cash-flow potential represents a massive capital asset.</li>
                  <li><strong>Neuralink & The Boring Company</strong>: Early-stage venture assets where Musk holds controlling equity blocks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For Elon Musk to achieve a net worth of $1 trillion, the combined equity value of these holdings must expand by a factor of three to four from their current levels. Assuming a compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% to 25%, Musk could cross the trillion-dollar threshold between 2030 and 2035.

                  Many investors still associate Tesla primarily with electric vehicles. However, the long-term <strong>Tesla valuation</strong> is fundamentally decoupled from legacy car manufacturing multiples. Musk's vision extends far beyond transportation, positioning Tesla as a combined AI, robotics, and energy infrastructure company.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The financial promise of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology lies in its software margins. Traditional automotive manufacturing operates on low single-digit net margins, whereas autonomous ride-hailing networks operate on software-as-a-service (SaaS) margins. If Tesla successfully deploys a scaled Robotaxi network, it shifts from selling depreciating hardware assets to generating recurring, high-margin utility fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, the humanoid robotics market through the Optimus program represents an addressable market that is theoretically larger than the global automotive industry. Optimus leverages the same inference hardware, neural network architectures, and battery technologies developed for Tesla's vehicle fleet. If humanoid robots can perform repetitive, labor-intensive tasks at a lower cost than human labor, the economic value generated would run into the trillions of dollars.

                  While Tesla receives most of the public attention, many analysts believe SpaceX could become Musk's most valuable asset. The company has effectively commoditized access to space, establishing a near-total vertical monopoly over the aerospace launch market.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ultimate <strong>SpaceX valuation</strong> is driven by the Starship launch system and the Starlink satellite broadband network. Starship is designed to be the first fully reusable, rapid-turnaround launch vehicle in history. By reducing the cost per kilogram to low Earth orbit (LEO) by orders of magnitude, Starship makes previously uneconomic orbital business models viable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While rocket launches are capital-intensive and transaction-limited, Starlink is a recurring consumer and enterprise subscription business. By utilizing SpaceX's low-cost launch capabilities, Starlink has deployed thousands of satellites to provide high-speed, low-latency broadband globally. As Starlink approaches financial maturity, an independent, cash-generating Starlink IPO could unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in liquid equity value.

                  The trajectory of the <strong>future of AI</strong> represents perhaps the most volatile yet impactful variable in Musk's wealth equation. Recognizing this shift, Musk launched xAI in 2023 to compete directly with OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The value proposition of <strong>xAI growth</strong> is built on massive compute density and deep integration with the wider Musk ecosystem. xAI demonstrated its execution speed by building the "Colossus" supercluster, utilizing 100,000 liquid-cooled Nvidia H100 GPUs in record time.

                <blockquote className="my-10 pl-6 border-l-3 border-primary italic text-[20px] text-muted-foreground font-serif leading-relaxed">
                  "By coupling xAI's real-time reasoning models with Tesla's physical robotics (Optimus) and autopilot vision networks, Musk is building a closed-loop system of compounding physical and digital intelligence."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  If xAI successfully develops systems that approach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the platform could automate complex cognitive tasks across industries, capturing an enormous share of global economic productivity.
