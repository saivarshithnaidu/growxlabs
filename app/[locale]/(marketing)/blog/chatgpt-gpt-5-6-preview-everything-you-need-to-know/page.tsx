  const faqData = [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna?",
      answer: "GPT-5.6 Sol is the flagship reasoning and agentic model. Terra is a balanced, cost-effective model for everyday workloads. Luna is a lightweight model optimized for speed and high-frequency API tasks."
    },
    {
      question: "Is GPT-5.6 available to all ChatGPT users?",
      answer: "No. GPT-5.6 is currently in a limited preview phase. OpenAI is granting access to trusted partners and select developers before rolling it out to the wider public in the coming weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Ultra Mode work in GPT-5.6 Sol?",
      answer: "Ultra Mode allows the model to coordinate multiple internal subagents (e.g. a researcher, a coder, and a tester) to complete complex, multi-file developer workflows autonomously within the context of a single request."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Terminal-Bench?",
      answer: "Terminal-Bench is a rigorous benchmark designed to evaluate an AI's ability to operate in a real shell environment, including installing packages, running test suites, and executing multi-file edits. GPT-5.6 Sol achieves a state-of-the-art 91.8% score."
    },
    {
      question: "Can GPT-5.6 write malware or execute exploit commands?",
      answer: "No. OpenAI has integrated strict guardrails that refuse requests to generate offensive cyber tools. When executing commands, the model runs inside an isolated, secure sandbox."
    },
    {
      question: "Will GPT-5.6 replace developers?",
      answer: "No. GPT-5.6 is designed to serve as an advanced assistant, handling repetitive work, boilerplate code, refactoring, and debugging. It allows developers to focus on architecture, design, and user experience."
    },
    {
      question: "Does GPT-5.6 support multi-modal inputs?",
      answer: "Yes. The model family features improved multimodal capabilities, allowing it to interpret images, diagrams, flowcharts, and technical layouts."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the pricing for the GPT-5.6 API?",
      answer: "Final pricing has not yet been announced. Sol is expected to be the most expensive due to its reasoning overhead, while Luna will be the most affordable."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Max Reasoning Mode?",
      answer: "Max Reasoning Mode forces the model to allocate extra compute time to think, plan, and self-correct before outputting an answer, which is ideal for mathematics, systems design, and security reviews."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upload files for the model to analyze?",
      answer: "Yes. GPT-5.6 features a large context window and high retrieval recall, allowing you to feed in entire code repositories, manuals, or research papers for analysis."
    },
    {
      question: "Does GPT-5.6 suffer from hallucinations?",
      answer: "While logic and reasoning improvements have dramatically reduced hallucinations, the model can still make errors on highly complex, undocumented edge cases."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the model manage state in long workflows?",
      answer: "GPT-5.6 uses built-in state serialization, allowing it to compress history and save execution states, keeping its context window clean during long-running tasks."
    },
    {
      question: "When will the public rollout happen?",
      answer: "OpenAI has stated that a broader rollout is planned in the coming weeks, following additional safety evaluations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use GPT-5.6 for automated unit testing?",
      answer: "Yes. The model can analyze your source code, identify edge cases, generate unit test files, run them in its sandbox, and repair any failures automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get access to the GPT-5.6 Preview?",
      answer: "You can request access through the OpenAI developer portal or join the enterprise waitlist."
    }

                  GPT-5.6 is OpenAI's newest generation of large language models focused on long-horizon reasoning, software engineering, cybersecurity, scientific research, and AI agents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead of releasing one universal model, OpenAI introduced three specialized variants:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>GPT-5.6 Sol</strong> — Flagship frontier model</li>

                  <li><strong>GPT-5.6 Luna</strong> — Fast, lightweight, and affordable model</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Each model targets a different balance of intelligence, speed, and cost while sharing improvements across reasoning, coding, and multimodal capabilities.

                <p>
                  The economics of running massive general-purpose models are becoming unsustainable for high-volume enterprise operations. Routing simple routing filters through the same colossal network that handles advanced biology calculations is extremely inefficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By creating a tiered model architecture, OpenAI optimizes both performance and server costs, allowing developers to route their calls to specific models that match the task requirements.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground">GPT-5.6 Sol</h3>
                <p>
                  Sol is OpenAI's most capable model to date. It is designed for advanced software engineering, multi-step reasoning, autonomous AI agents, research, scientific workflows, biology, and enterprise automation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  OpenAI also introduces two reasoning modes for Sol:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Max Reasoning Mode</strong>: The model spends significantly more computation on difficult problems before responding. Ideal for mathematics, system design, large codebases, research papers, and architecture planning.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ultra Mode</strong>: Ultra mode extends beyond traditional reasoning by orchestrating multiple internal subagents to tackle complex, long-running tasks more effectively. This makes GPT-5.6 Sol particularly well suited for autonomous development workflows and sophisticated AI agent systems.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8">GPT-5.6 Terra</h3>
                <p>
                  Terra is designed as the balanced everyday model. It delivers performance comparable to GPT-5.5 while reducing inference costs substantially. It is best suited for chatbots, SaaS products, business automation, customer support, and content generation.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8">GPT-5.6 Luna</h3>
                <p>
                  Luna is optimized for speed and affordability. Its focus areas include high-volume API requests, real-time assistants, AI search, mobile applications, background processing, and large-scale automation.
                </p>

                  Coding is one of GPT-5.6's biggest strengths. According to OpenAI, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Terminal-Bench, demonstrating stronger abilities in debugging, refactoring, shell commands, git workflows, tool usage, planning, and multi-file editing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Developers can expect more reliable code generation with fewer iterations. The model can automatically write test suites, run compiles in a sandboxed command prompt, resolve compile errors autonomously, and commit clean changes to a Git branch.

                  While older models were passive predictors, GPT-5.6 Sol's Ultra Mode acts as an active agentic coordinator. It can spawn subagents to work on subtasks concurrently, review their code output, test execution states, and handle coordination details.

            <WhyThisMatters>
              GPT-5.6 signals OpenAI's shift toward specialized, tiered AI systems rather than relying on a single general-purpose model. This allows businesses and developers to optimize performance and operational margins simultaneously.
