      question: "What is GrowX Labs Tech and what services do you offer?",
      answer: "GrowX Labs Tech is a growing AI-native software company and product studio based in India. We specialize in custom software development, AI agent engineering, intelligent automation solutions, and mobile and web application development. We combine deep AI expertise with rapid product development to ship production-ready solutions in weeks, built to scale from day one. We don't build off-the-shelf systems. We build products."
    },
    {
      question: "How is GrowX Labs Tech different from other consultancies?",
      answer: "Traditional IT firms often operate as body shops or spend months writing discovery documents before writing any code. We do the opposite: we are an AI-first software lab that prioritizes working software. Within 24 hours of kickoff, you get a functional prototype, and we deploy complete, scalable production systems in 2 to 8 weeks. Every engineer on our team has been building with LLMs and neural architectures natively from day one—we don't 'retrofit' AI into legacy software. When you build with us, you collaborate directly with the core developers writing your code, eliminating project management overhead and junior developer errors."
    },
    {
      question: "What industries does GrowX Labs Tech work with?",
      answer: "We work across multiple sectors including fintech, e-commerce, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, logistics, education, and professional services. Our AI solutions are industry-agnostic but highly customisable: whether you need intelligent document processing for banking, AI-powered inventory management for retail, or automated customer support for SaaS, we build solutions tailored to your specific domain requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Can GrowX Labs Tech help with enterprise AI implementation and digital transformation?",
      answer: "Yes. We help mid-size companies and enterprise teams deploy AI across their operations. This covers AI strategy consulting, workflow automation, intelligent process automation (IPA), custom LLM deployment, RAG systems for enterprise knowledge management, and AI-driven analytics dashboards. We start with a discovery sprint to identify high-impact opportunities, then deliver proof-of-concept systems designed to scale."
    },
    {
      question: "What AI and automation solutions does GrowX Labs Tech build?",
      answer: "We engineer custom AI agents for sales automation, customer support chatbots, lead qualification systems, document processing pipelines, and AI-powered CRM integrations. We also build WhatsApp and email automation, intelligent data extraction tools, predictive analytics systems, and generative AI applications. Our solutions integrate seamlessly with your existing tech stack, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, SAP, and custom ERPs."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does custom software development cost at GrowX Labs Tech?",
      answer: "Our custom software development projects typically start at ₹1 lakh (approximately $1,200 USD) for focused AI agents and automations. Mid-complexity web and mobile applications range from ₹3-10 lakhs, while enterprise-grade platforms with multiple integrations start at ₹10 lakhs and above. We offer transparent pricing upfront based on scope, providing highly competitive rates compared to traditional IT consultancies while delivering faster results."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the typical project timeline for software development?",
      answer: "We operate at high velocity. AI agents and automations typically take 1-2 weeks; web applications and MVPs take 4-6 weeks; and complex enterprise systems require 8-12 weeks. We deliver a working prototype within 24-48 hours of kickoff so you can validate the direction early, and our iterative development ensures you see regular progress every few days."
    },
    {
      question: "Does GrowX Labs Tech provide ongoing support and maintenance?",
      answer: "Yes. We provide flexible support and maintenance plans that cover bug fixes, performance monitoring, security updates, feature enhancements, and 24/7 incident response for business-critical systems. Many clients begin with an initial build phase and transition to a monthly retainer to ensure continuous system optimization and ongoing support."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you build AI chatbots and virtual assistants for customer service?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We design and deploy intelligent customer support systems that handle FAQs, order tracking, appointment scheduling, complaint resolution, and complex multi-turn conversations. Our AI assistants integrate directly with the WhatsApp Business API, web chat, email, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. They learn from your proprietary knowledge base and escalate to human agents only when necessary, reducing customer support costs by 40-70%."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer AI consulting and strategy services?",
      answer: "Yes. Our AI consulting services include AI readiness assessments, use-case prioritization, technology stack recommendations, build-vs-buy analysis, AI governance frameworks, and implementation roadmaps. We help leadership teams understand where AI can drive the most value and construct actionable plans to achieve it, whether that involves engineering custom solutions or integrating existing AI tools."
    },
    {
      question: "What technologies and frameworks does GrowX Labs Tech use?",
      answer: "We work with modern, production-grade technologies: React, Next.js, Node.js, Python, and TypeScript for applications; OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and open-source LLMs for AI; PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis for databases; AWS, Google Cloud, and Vercel for infrastructure; and tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex for AI orchestration. We choose the right stack for each project based on requirements, avoiding vendor lock-in."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with GrowX Labs Tech?",
      answer: "Contact us at sai@growxlabs.tech or through our website contact form. We will schedule a 30-minute discovery call to understand your requirements, assess fit, and outline a preliminary technical approach. If we are aligned, we can deliver a proposal within 48 hours and start work within a week, bypassing lengthy procurement processes or multi-month sales cycles."
